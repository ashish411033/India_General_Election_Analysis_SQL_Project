# India_General_Election_Analysis_SQL_Project
This project analyzes the 2024 Indian General Election results using SQL on structured datasets like Constituency-wise, Party-wise, and State-wise results. It extracts insights such as top parties, vote share by state, seat distribution, and winning margins through SQL-based data exploration and aggregation.

## 📌 Project Overview
The analysis is based on the following key datasets:
- 📍 **Constituency-wise Details**
- 📊 **Constituency-wise Results**
- 🏛️ **Party-wise Results**
- 🌐 **State-wise Results**
- 🗺️ **States Master List**


## 🧠 Key SQL Concepts Used
- `JOIN` operations across multiple tables  
- `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `HAVING` for aggregation  
- `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, and `ROW_NUMBER()` window functions  
- Filtering with `WHERE` and `IN` clauses  
- Calculations for vote share, margin %, and seat counts  


## 📚 Learning Outcomes
- Apply **SQL** to real-world political and public datasets  
- Understand how to clean, relate, and query election data  
- Derive analytical insights like top parties, close contests, and vote splits  
- Build the foundation for further visualization using tools like **Power BI** or **Tableau**


## 🛠 Tools Used
